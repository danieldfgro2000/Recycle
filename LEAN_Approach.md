# LEAN Approach

#### Project to be divided in 3 main parts:
###### AWARE(low)   |   PRODUCT (Mid) |  SCALE(High)
#
#### This years INNOVATION LAB ENDAVA
#
### Phone App (low)
#### Technology
Android Studio IDE, JAVA / KOTLIN, Firebase SDK

Options to be implented:

    * Recycle Map
    * Comunity
    * INFO (AWARE)
    * Product PROMO
    * Market response (community)
    
Further INFO:

   https://www.qualitylogoproducts.com/promo-university/different-types-of-plastic.htm
    
   * identify and categorize different plastic materials
   * propose different *recycled* products;
   * smart recycle Bin - create raw material (wire/block - First Product)   
 
 Analyze capability - further development (time constraint) 
   * connect to 3D printer
   * material requirements (type and quantity)
   * allow community to share knowledge;
   
   Connect to store to share bill and quickly identify used materials and how can they be recycled

### Future development (Just presentation during this years INNOVATION LAB ENDAVA) 
### Big Corporations Smart Recycle Bin (mid)  

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/azure-kinect-dk/8pp5vxmd9nhq?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
* Smart bin capable of categorising waste material (See BIN-E)

        next step - available products
* develop low cost machine learning object detection system;
* develop 3D printer for wide range materials;
* integrate CNC machine;
* PROMOTE successful products made out of recycled materials, based on data analysis (community)    
* machine output capability of finite product;
* Recycle cost reduction capability;


### Industry level equipment, long term contract with legal entity (high)
* high cost for initial investment 
* there are options available
* Develop, maintain and improve SW


# Materials to be recycled

## Plastic
###### Focus on plastic - most polluting low energy requirements to process
